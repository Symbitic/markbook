# Markbook

The user and developer guide to Markbook.

**Markbook** is a command-line tool that allows writers to author books written
in CommonMark. It shares many concepts and similarities with both [GitBook] and
[mdBook].

This very guide is written in CommonMark, to serve as an example of how to use
markbook.

Markbook is free and open source under the MIT license. The source code is
available on GitHub at <https://github.com/Symbitic/markbook>. Feature requests,
issues, and pull requests are all welcome.
